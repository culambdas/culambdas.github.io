### Things to note
- The ```main``` branch will be for deployment, so work off of the ```development``` branch. Then, merge into ```main``` when ready for new release.
- If there are multiple people working on the website, then create another branch from ```development```, make your own feature, and resolve conflicts when merging.

### Incoming feature
- There will be a really simple Firestore database of all bros and their info. I will put the credentials and db specifications here later.
- There will also be an admin page for administrative matters or adding/deleting bros.
- Further features to be discussed.
