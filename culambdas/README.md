# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Adding a new class (READ PLEASE)

There are certain files you must change when you add a new class
- members.json (Update big bros and little bros)
- actives.json (Copy paste from members.json)
- Update `allClasses` in constants.js
- Add new class images to assets/classes and assets/members (**IMPORTANT**: Use jpg and compress photos -> Refer to [tutorial](http://tutorialshares.com/batch-convert-png-jpg-mac-terminal/)) 
- Update the state property `activeClass` in ActiveHouse.js and Roster.js to be the newest class
- Run `npm run build` and `npm run deploy`

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run deploy`

Run `npm run build` before running this command. Updates the github pages build with the latest version.
