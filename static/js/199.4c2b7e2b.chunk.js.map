Founded in 1981 at UCLA, Lambda\r\n            Phi Epsilon seeks to promote Asian American awareness and is\r\n            uniquely tailored to the Asian American experience.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            Traditional Asian campus organizations often split along lines of\r\n            national origins and often lack continuity in the memberships in\r\n            those organizations with yearly turnover of officers and members.\r\n            Student associations provide a circle of friends during your\r\n            undergraduate experience and at worst, familiar strangers during\r\n            periodic social functions. Lambda Phi Epsilon is an organization\r\n            that is rich in tradition, values, and vision and seeks to enrich\r\n            the male college student experience. We offer brotherhood that will\r\n            endure the passage of time. We perform community service, are\r\n            involved in the Asian American community, cultivate meaningful and\r\n            lasting relationships, and look out for all of our brothers across\r\n            the country, all while maintaining high academic standards. We study\r\n            hard; we work hard; we play hard.\r\n          </p>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div className=\"flex-container\">\r\n        <div className=\"col-6 justify-text\">\r\n          <h2>Brotherhood</h2>\r\n          <p>\r\n            By joining, you will enter a brotherhood that offers friendships\r\n            that last a lifetime. Unlike many college friends who turn out to be\r\n            \"class friends\" or \"semester friends,\" Lambda Phi Epsilon offers\r\n            brotherhood that values trust and loyalty to the highest. Our\r\n            brotherhood is expressed in our motto,{' '}\r\n            <b>\"To Be Leaders Among Men\"</b>. We not only seek to bring together\r\n            a diverse group of men who share interests, concerns, backgrounds,\r\n            and cultures, but who believe that the strength of many is forged\r\n            into the power of being one. If you ever had a best friend, you know\r\n            the closeness you feel with them.

By\r\n            forming Lambda Phi Epsilon as a new Asian American fraternity, the\r\n            founders hoped to set new and higher standards of excellence for all\r\n            Asian interest organizations to follow. The goal of the founders was\r\n            to transcend the limitations to which traditional Asian American\r\n            organizations were subject. They sought to draw their membership\r\n            from all of the diverse segments of the Asian American community.\r\n            Their vision was that members would eventually become leaders in\r\n            their respective communities and bridge gaps fragmenting the Asian\r\n            American community through their affiliation with a common\r\n            organization. Unknowingly, their efforts had set the stage for the\r\n            emergence of the largest organization of its kind.\r\n          </p>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div className=\"col-4 reverse\">\r\n          <img\r\n            src={require('../../assets/images/national-history-2.jpeg').default}\r\n            className=\"about-image\"\r\n            alt=\"National History\"\r\n          />\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div className=\"flex-container\">\r\n        <div className=\"col-4\">\r\n          <img\r\n            src={require('../../assets/images/national-history-3.jpeg').default}\r\n            className=\"about-image\"\r\n            alt=\"National History\"\r\n          />\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div className=\"col-6 justify-text\">\r\n          <p style={{ marginTop: 0 }}>\r\n            By 1990, six chapters had formed at the Universities of California\r\n            at Los Angeles, Davis, Santa Barbara, Berkeley and Irvine and at the\r\n            University of Texas at Austin.
