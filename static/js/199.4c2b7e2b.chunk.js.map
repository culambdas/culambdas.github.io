Lambda Phi Epsilon is an organization\n            that is rich in tradition, values, and vision and seeks to enrich\n            the male college student experience. We offer brotherhood that will\n            endure the passage of time. We perform community service, are\n            involved in the Asian American community, cultivate meaningful and\n            lasting relationships, and look out for all of our brothers across\n            the country, all while maintaining high academic standards.
